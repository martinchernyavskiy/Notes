#### General Notes
- Paradigm
	- Recursive
		- Number of distinct subproblems in recursion tree remains slow
		- Each solved only once
- Memoization
	- Keep track of computed solutions
	- Top-down
	- Generic
- Iteration
	- Bottom-up
	- Build upp table of solved instances from easier to harder
	- Ad hoc process
- 

### Fibonacci
?
- Trivial 
	- Depth of n, 2^n normally
	- Recursion tree, recurrence for number of additions A(n)
	- Golden ration to the n
- Use memoization, reserve array
	- Complexity O(n)
	- O(n^2) for bit complexity and space complexity
	- Iterative approach allows for O(1) space complexity since we only need to know previous 2 values in the table
