### Intro

- Prioritiy Quee 
	- Maintain a set of elements S and each has an associated value k.
	- insert / minimum / extract min / decrease x by k / create 
	- implemented via heap. value of parent <= child value
- Dynamic Dictionary
	- Find: O(log(n))
	- Insertion / deletion (O(log(n)))

- Graphs
	- *Must mention implementation*
		- Adjacency Matrix:
			- Imagine nodes are labelled 1 through n
			- A(i,j) is 1 iff there is edge between i to j vertices
	- If graph is not sparse, it's not so great O(n^2) edges

- Adjacency List
	- for every node, we maintain a list it's connected to
	- good for sparse graphs
