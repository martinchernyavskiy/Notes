## Algorithm/Program Specification
?
- *Importance:*
- What are effects but not how they are achieved
- Modular design, can easily understand what the algorithm/program does without delving into details
- Correctness
- *Components*:
	- Valid inputs
	- Correct output
	- Side effects (if any on data structures)
- *Properties*:
	- Unambiguous
	- Succint 
	- Stand alone
- *Example*:
	- Greatest Common Divisor
		- Input: a,b in $\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ 
		- Output: gcd(a, b)

## Algorithm Correctness
?
- *Proof that algorithm realizes the specification. Meaning for all valid inputs the algorithm products correct output*
