## CPU and RAM
?
- CPU has *registers* which are like variables built in it
- CPU clock oscillates billions of times per second
- For adding numbers in RAM, we need to load before adding and then storing them after
- *Latency*
- Loading a value from RAM takes about 60ns or 200 cycles
		- Slow but not long enough to switch to a different process
