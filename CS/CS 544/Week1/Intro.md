- *Analysis code* (run once, get result)
- *Applications* (long running / website)
- Systems (manage resources)
	- operating system is a backbone of analysis code
### Resource Categories
?
Computer:
- CPU, GPU for computing
- RAM for active memory
Resources:
- *Storage* (long-term data)
- *Network* (provides communication between computers)
	- Managed by Network Interface Card (*NIC*)

## Bid Data Systems
?
Servers whose datasets grow may run too slowly or not run at all given there is not enough memory.
- *Scale Up / Out* or *More efficient code*
- *Distributed* (cluster of machines)
- *Specialized* (GPUs)

## Compute
- Some computers use multiple CPUs and CPUs may have multiply cores.
