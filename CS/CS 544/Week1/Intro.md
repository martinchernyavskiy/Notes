## Software Categories
?
*Systems* : *Software for managing computer resources*
- *Analysis code* (run once, get result)
- *Applications* (long running / website)
- Systems (manage resources)
	- operating system is a backbone of analysis code
### Resource Categories
?
Computer:
- CPU, GPU for computing
- RAM for active memory
Resources:
- *Storage* (long-term data)
- *Network* (provides communication between computers)
	- Managed by Network Interface Card (*NIC*)

## Bid Data Systems
?
Servers whose datasets grow may run too slowly or not run at all given there is not enough memory.
- *Scale Up / Out* or *More efficient code*
- *Distributed* (cluster of machines)
- *Specialized* (GPUs)

## Compute
?
- Some computers use multiple CPUs and CPUs may have multiply *cores*.
- OS *schedules tasks* on cores
- Each core can execute instructions for one/two tasks at a time
	- Each instruction is written in machine code that CPU operates on
- The more cores available, the more tasks can be ran in *parallel*


## High-Language Interpreter
- High level code can either be *compiled* into
