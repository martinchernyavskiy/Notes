## Pointers and Addresses
?
- *Pointer*: variable that contains the address of a variable
- Allow for efficient code and clarity
- Consecutive addressed memory cells of 1 byte size
- "`&`" unary operator gives the address of an object (p = &c;) and thus acts as a *pointer*
- Can only be applied to objects in memory
- "`*`" unary operator is *indirection or dereferencing* operator, when applied to pointer, accesses the object that the pointer `points` to.
```C
double *dp, atof(char *);
```
