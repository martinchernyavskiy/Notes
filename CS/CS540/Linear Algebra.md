## Usage
- Linear Functions are simple and tractable
	- Building blocks for all models (linear regression, part of neural networks)
- Vectors
	- Can be list of values or point in space
	- Dimension
	- In AI/ML we use particularly high dimensions
- Matrices
	- Table of values / vectors
	- Represent linear transformations
	- If we apply to a vector, we get another
	- mxn dimension
	- Can easily index into matrix
- Transposition
	- Flips rows and co
