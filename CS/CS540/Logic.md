*Important in the AI field, language of knowledge representation, databases, etc.*

## Symbolic vs. Connectionist 
- Connectionist (showcases relations through arrows and nodes)
- Popular in probabilistic models and neural networks
- May allow AI to write formally verifiable proofs
- *Which is the best?*
	- Combination of the two, like in Markov Logic Networks

## Basics of Logic
- Argument: a set of sentences (premises) + a concluding sentence
- Validity: argument is valid iff all premises are true and conclusion is true
- Soundness: argument is sound iff valid & premises true
- Entailment: when valid argument, premises entail conclusion

## Propositional Logic Basics
- Sentences, symbols, connectives, parentheses
- P,Q,R atomic sentences
- Connectives include (conjunction, disjunction, implication, biconditional, negation)
	- Precedence follows: not --> and --> or --> imply --> biconditional
	- Parentheses when needed

## Sentences & Semantics
- Interpretation: (True/False in truth table)
- Semantics: Interpretations for which sentences evaluate to true
- Model: interpretation for which all sentences are true

## Knowledge Bases
- A set of sentences A1 to An 
- Goal: inference to discover new sentences

## Entailment
- If sentence B logically follows from A, then we write A|=B
