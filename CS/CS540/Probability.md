## Random Variables
?
- X: maps random point to real values
- P(X = 3): what is the probability of random variable has having a value of 3
- *Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)*: $F_{X}(x) := P(X \leq x)$
- *Density / Mass function (PDF)*: $p_{X}(x)$: basically a derivative of CDF
- Expectation (average): $E[X] = \sum_{a}^{}a \times P(x=a)$
- Variance (spread): $Var[X]=E[(X-E[X])^2]$

## Join Distribution
- Move from one variable to several
- Joint distribution: P(X = a, Y = b)
	- Allows to work with multiple types of uncertainty that correlate with each other
- Marginal Probability
