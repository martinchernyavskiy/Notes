Encoding = process of translation between information that humans can understand to machine language


### ASCII 
- American Standard Code for Information Interchange
- 7 bits to represent 128 different characters
- Alphanumeric characters, so similar bit representation for upper-case, lowercase, or numbers 
- Also include punctuation and control characters

### Coding standards used today
- Unicode (UTF-16), 16-bit coding scheme, extended to 32 bits (UTF-32)
- In both, first 128 code values are ASCII character set.
- Sophisticated encoding scheme which represents characters, glyphs, sequences and more.
- UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format 8-bit)
	- Encodes each unicode character as 1-4 bytes
	- ASCII represented by single byte
	- Default for XML encoding
