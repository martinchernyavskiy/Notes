### Adding Methodology
- Think of numbers as poker chips where if addition exceed's base max digit value, the numbers get readjusted accordingly

### Subtraction Methodology 
- Borrow base's value from one position higher if necessary

### Multiplication Methodology
- Multiplying by a power of the base essentially shifts number by one digit left, adding 0 at the 0 number position.

### Division Methodology
- Opposite of multiplication, instead when dividing by the power of the base we shift number right.
- 0s get cut off from the number while other numbers are shifted past dot (radix point), representing fractional values
-
