	- Repeatedly divide by the base number, substituting remainder in the digit's place until left with 0 quotient
	Example:
	To convert from decimal to hexadecimal:

		Next divide the quotient (number after division) by 16 again and place remainder as the next digit
		Repeat the process until a 0 quotient
