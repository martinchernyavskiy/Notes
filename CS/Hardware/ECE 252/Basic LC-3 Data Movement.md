### Memory Access
- Since REG File contains only 8 registers, some programs may need to read/write from memory since there are $2^{16}$ registers
- REG File is too small to be used for storage space, it can be viewed rather as a temporary storage for data to be used in ALU operations


### Label as a Location
- Similar to variables in programming
- Assembler directive is used for naming a memory location that will hold a word of data instead of instruction
-
