### Universal Computational Device (computer)
- Description of the task (program)
- Input data 

### Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- Computational multi-functional structure in a processor that performs arithmetic or logical operations
- The logic operations are bitwise in ALU 
- All logic structures work in parallel, however for one step of a program only one result of those operations is needed
- *Use multiplexers to select the result*
