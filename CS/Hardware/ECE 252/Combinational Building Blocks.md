### Decoders
- Converts an n-bit input codeword into a unique m-bit output value, where $m = 2^n$
- There are $2^n$ unique n-bit inputs for each of which there is only one unique m-bit output value
- Input signal values determine which output can be true
- An analogy would be the telephone system where the input is the phone number of a person and the output is the phone ringing (decoder output is true), while for the rest people in the world the phone doesn't ring
- Example of decoders:
	1-2 decoder
	2-4 decoder
	3-8 decoder
- Outputs are labeled with the value of the input code
- Inputs are labeled based on how they should be arranged to form a binary number
