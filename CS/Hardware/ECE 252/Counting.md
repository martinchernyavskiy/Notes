### Digit Incrementing
- A digit increments if all digits to its right are at their max values. Then all of the less-significant digits rotate back to 0
- If all digits are at their max and we have limited number of digits, the count wraps to zero and enters overflow state.
- Overflow - the represented value can't be represented due to not having enough number of digits
