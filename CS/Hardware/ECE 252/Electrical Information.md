## Data types
?
- ### Digital
	Discrete set of values, various restrictions
- ### Analog
	No restrictions on minimum and maximum levels, continuous range of values

## Digital Information
?
- Transistors are tiny digital on-off switches that perform computations by controlling voltage levels, which represent information being processed.
- To solve complexity, we break voltage levels into 2 only.

## Binary Digital Information
?
- Use ranges of voltages to represent either 1 or 0 (binary representation)
- Can't let 1 meet 0 on a given wire

## Bits for information
?
- Wire transmits a bit as a voltage level
- To represent more than 2 different values at the same time, we use multiple bits each transmitted on its own wire
- For 3 wires, there are 8 possible values that can be transmitted, but only one at a time

## Binary Information

- Any type of data processed by computer is represented by sequences of 1s and 0s.
- Computers don't know how to interpret binary numbers from the just the bits. Thus, we have to give computer the correct data to process with the correct instructions to process it.
