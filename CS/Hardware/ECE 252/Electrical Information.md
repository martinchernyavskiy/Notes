## Data types

- ### Digital
	Discrete set of values, various restrictions
- ### Analog
	No restrictions on minimum and maximum levels, continuous range of values

## Digital Information

- Transistors are tiny digital on-off switches that perform computations by controlling voltage levels, which represent information being processed.
- To solve complexity, we break voltage levels into 2 only.

## Binary Digital Information
