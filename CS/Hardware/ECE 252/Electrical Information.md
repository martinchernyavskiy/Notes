## Data types
?
- ### Digital
	Discrete set of values, various restrictions
- ### Analog
	No restrictions on minimum and maximum levels, continuous range of values

## Digital Information
?
- Transistors are tiny digital on-off switches that perform computations by controlling voltage levels, which represent information being processed.
- To solve complexity, we break voltage levels into 2 only.

## Binary Digital Information
?
- Use ranges of voltages to represent either 1 or 0 (binary representation)
- Can't let 1 meet 0 on a given wire

## Bits for information
?
- Wire transmits a bit as a voltage level
- To represent more than 2 different values at the same time, we use multiple bits each transmitted on its own wire
- For 3 wires, there are 8 possible values that can be transmitted, but only one at a time
