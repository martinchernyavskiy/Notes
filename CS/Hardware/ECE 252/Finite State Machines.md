### Flip-Flop representation of FSM
- Each flip-flop corresponds to a bit of state
- Code stored in FSM's flip-flops tells what's the current state of the FSM
- FSMs contains a combinational logic circuit that computes next state from circuit's inputs and the current state
- Starting state is indicated by an arrow pointing at it from void, labeled "reset"
