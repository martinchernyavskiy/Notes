### Flip-Flop representation of FSM
- Each flip-flop corresponds to a bit of state
- Code stored in FSM's flip-flops tells what's the current state of the FSM
- FSMs contains a combinational logic circuit that computes next state from circuit's inputs and the current state
- Starting state is indicated by an arrow pointing at it from void, labeled "reset"

### Shorthand Notation
- 2-bit counter can always count upon a rising edge without a particular input (transition arrows are not labeled and there is only one of each state). 
- The transition that is not influenced by the input values is an unconditional transition
- Unconditional transitions may or may not be labeled

### FSM implementation
- Determine number of flip-flops based on the number of bits of state.
