### Decimal 
- In decimal non-integer, each digit past radix point (decimal point in decimal) is 1 divided by the base raised to the digit's position number (starting at 1), or 


### Other Bases
- Real numbers for other bases follow the same logic as for the decimal. We can extend the idea of digit positions to include negative position numbers.
- Radix point separates integer portion from the fractional portion of the number
- N-digit non-negative number with radix r 
- We do the same in order to break the base into two which is similar to making cantor bases since the format is the same.
