### Key Info
- Low-level language with one-to-one correspondence between assembly language instructions and machine instructions
- Reduces tedious work that comes from working with binary by using symbolic names for labels and instruction opcodes. Assembler automatically calculates and sets the offset for instructions that access a particular memory address
- Every assembly language is tied to a specific ISA and have different syntax
### Running a Program
- Assemble the source code
- Load program into the memory (real processor includes a special hardware to write the assembled program binary into memory)
- Execute the program
