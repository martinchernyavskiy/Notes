### Structured Programming
- Uses 3 fundamental constructs:
	- Sequence
		- *Ordered rectangular subtask blocks with one entry and exit arrows*
	- Selection (condition)
		- *Diamond-shaped decision block in flowchart*
		- One of the two exit paths will be chosen per condition
		- *If/Else*
	- Iteration
		- Uses decision block with one paths leading back to the decision block input repeatedly until the other condition holds
		- *While/For*
