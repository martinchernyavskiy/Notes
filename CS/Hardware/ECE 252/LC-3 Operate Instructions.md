### Operate Instructions
- Use PU
- 1 or 2 source operands read from reg file (2nd might be immediate value)
- ALUout stored back into reg file
- WE is always enabled
- Updates condition codes


### NOT 
- Opcode: 1001
- Single operand
- The value is bitwise complemented by ALU
- We often represent binary strings in hexadecimal for easier viewing, but processors operate fully in binary
- In LC-3 Assembly Language, no binary is used, but a mnemonic that represents the opcode, followed by operands
- Higher level of abstraction includes a register transfer language 


### ADD
- Opcode: 0001
- Same signals generated by instruction decode logic, however signal to ALU now specifies add logic
- Instruction contains MODE field to specify the type of operands
-
