### Logic Circuits
- Made of logic gates, which are made of transistors, connecting each output to power or ground based on the design of the circuit and the voltage level of each input 
- We focus primarily on the boolean representation of the inputs values and boolean results

### Role of Transistors
- Acts like a mocroscopic switch, either allowing or disallowing curr
