### Flowchart
- Using flowchart is essential before actually starting to code
- Solve the problem at higher level and expect to make revisions
- Use self-descriptive names, but make sure they are short
- Test flowchart before implementation
- *Don't start coding until defined the problem and know how to solve it*
- *Test early and frequently, not when the whole program is completed*
