### Program Design and Coding
- #### Top-down Design
- Start design at top level and work way down to the subroutine hierarchy
- Develop flowcharts for each subroutine
- #### Bottom-up Coding
- Code up subroutines first to test and ensure they work properly before moving up a level


### strupr
- R1 contains the address of ASCIIZ string
- *Uses pass-by-reference*
- Does not return a result
```asm

```

### toupper
