### Registers
- A register is a group of flip-flops used to store multi-bit binary values
- All of flip-flops in a register are controlled by the same clock signal 
  Drawn at a higher level of abstraction
- Input and output pins that are not single bits are labeled with a slash and number of bits and drawn as a heavier line than the single bit wires and are called buses
