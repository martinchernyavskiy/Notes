### Combinational Circuits
- Outputs depend only on current input values
- Don't know anything about the past information
- No stored information


### Sequential Circuits
- Keep past information as memory
- Only key information is enough that is specific for a particular machine
- Variety of structures used in digital circuits to store a single bit of information


### D flip-flop
- One bit data input, one bit data output, and a special input called "clock" that controls when flip-flop can store a new value

### Clock Signal
- Signal that oscillates between 1 and 0 at a specific frequency (Hz, or cycles per second)
- Clock period is the time it takes for a single cycle 
- Flip-flop can update its stored value only on the positive (rising) edge of the clock signal

### Flip-Flop Behavior 
- D flip-flop updates when the clock transitions from 0 to 1, thus it's edge sensitive
