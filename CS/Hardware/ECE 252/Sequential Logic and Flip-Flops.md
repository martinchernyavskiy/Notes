### Combinational Circuits
- Outputs depend only on current input values
- Don't know anything about the past information
- No stored information


### Sequential Circuits
- Keep past information as memory
- Only key information is enough that is specific for a particular machine
- Variety of structures used in digital circuits to store a single bit of information


### D flip-flop
- One bit data input and output
