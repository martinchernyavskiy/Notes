### Decimal
- Put plus / minus in front of a number to indicate its sign (usually omit plus sign). We call it a signed-magnitude

### Binary
- The most-significant bit is the sign (1 is negative)
- Remaining bits are number's magnitude (0010 for +2, 1010 for -2)
- Easy for humans, hard for computers
