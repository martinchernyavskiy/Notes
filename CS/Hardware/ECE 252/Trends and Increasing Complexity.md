## History
?
- 1947 - 1st transistor
- 1971 - 1st microprocessor (Intel)
- Number of transistors generally doubles every 2 years as proposed by Gordon Moore (Moore's Law)

## Effects
?
- As number of transistors double every 2 years, the cost halves
- Computers become more cost-effective for variety of fields, revolutionizing industries
- Other components experience improvement also (size, cost, memory, display, connectivity)
