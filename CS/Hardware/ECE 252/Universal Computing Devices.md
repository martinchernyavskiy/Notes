## Turing Machine

- Proposed by Alan Turing
- Any computable computation can be implemented by some machine 
	- Reads/Writes one symbol on an infinite tape
	- Selects action to perform from a fixed set of rules based on symbol and current state of the machine
	- Elevator example

## Universal Turing Machine

- Can simulate any other Turing machine by inputting a description of that machine's behavior rules
- Programmable computer is effectively a UTM (but finite memory/tape)

## Key Themes

- Given enough memory and time, a computer can compute anything that's possible to compute. However in practice, there are more constraints:
	1. Time ()
	2. Cost
	3. Power/Energy
