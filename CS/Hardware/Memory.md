## Types

### Primary Memory
*Stored data that is being actively used. Includes Random Access Memory (RAM), which is volatile (loses its contents when power is turned off), and cache memory, which is faster but smaller in size,*

### Secondary Memory (Storage)
*Includes devices like hard drives, solid state drives (SSDs), and optical drives. Secondary memory is non-volatile and used for long-term storage of data and programs.*

## Role in computers

*All data in computers is represented using binary digits (bits), which are either 0 or 1. 8 bits grouped together form a byte. Bytes are the fundamental units of storage and manipulation in computers.*

## Accessing Memory

*Each byte in memory has a unique hexadecimal address, allowing the CPU to access and manipulate the data.*

## Memory Management Unit (MMU)

*Translates virtual addresses (used by programs) to physical addresses (used by the hardware). The CPU communicates with the MMU to access memory locations based on the virtual addresses, and the MMU handles the translation to physical addresses*
