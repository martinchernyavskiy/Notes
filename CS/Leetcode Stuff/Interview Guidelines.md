## Types of Coding Interviews
- Online Assessment: timed remote test
- Phone Screen: behavioral/technical 
	- Evaluate understanding of the company and the role
	- Expect coding challenges

## What Interviewers Look For
- Great knowledge of DSA, when and how to use them to solve the problem efficiently
- Clear communication, explain reasoning, discuss trade-offs, ensure that the interviewer is following along
- Engage with interviewer, ask clarifying questions, try to collaborate
- Write clean and efficient code (readable, clean, efficient)
- Identify where you can optimize solution's time and space complexity
- Be open to feedback and consider alternative solutions
- Test code and debug errors


## Steps to Approach a Problem
1. Restate the problem in own words, ask clarifying questions to gather all necessary constraints and edge cases
2. Design an algorithm
	- Consider and discuss multiple possible solutions, evaluate which one will work best and explain why
	- Consider first writing in pseudocode if an algorithm is complex, so that you have a guide on how to write the actual code
	- If struggle, consider brute force solution
3. Provide approximate time and space complexity estimate
	- Provide initial complexity analysis to demonstrate how effective it is
	- Approximately is acceptable, but more thorough analysis can be done once coded up
4. Write clean and readable code
	- Use meaningful variable names
	- Consider using helped functions
	- Design custom classes to improve readability
5. Once you have the code, clearly state the time and space complexities
	- Mention if there are any differences between this and initially stated complexity, explain the difference.
6. Test your code
	- Test simple cases
	- Test edge cases (extreme inputs that can break code)
	- Test boundary values
	- Use testing to identify bugs and fix code
