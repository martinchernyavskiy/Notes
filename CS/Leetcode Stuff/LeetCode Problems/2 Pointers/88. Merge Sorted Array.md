## Problem
?
```
You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

**Merge** `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be _stored inside the array_ `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
**Output:** [1,2,2,3,5,6]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
**Output:** [1]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
**Output:** [1]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.

**Constraints:**

- `nums1.length == m + n`
- `nums2.length == n`
- `0 <= m, n <= 200`
- `1 <= m + n <= 200`
- `-109 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 109`

**Follow up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?
```

## Logic
?
- Most efficient to work backwards
	- End of nums1 is empty, no need to constantly shift existing elements of nums1 to the right
	- Fill largest numbers first
- Create three pointers
	- 1 to keep track of last valid elements in nums1
	- 1 to keep track of last element in nums2
	- placement pointer to point to the very end of nums1 array
- As long as still have elements in both arrays, compare the pointers of both arrays
	- The one that is larger should be copied to nums1(p) position
	- Decrement pointer of number that was just used
	- Decrement placement pointer since we filled the spot
- When done with the loop, one of the pointers might not have reached the beginning
	- If p1, p1 already contains those elements in valid order, skip
	- If p2, copy the rest nums2 numbers into remaining empty spots at the front of nums1

## Solution
?
```Python
class Solution:
	def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:
        # pointer for last element of initial nums1
        p1 = m - 1

        # pointer for last element of nums 2
        p2 = n - 1

        # pointer for the last spot in merged nums1 array
        p = m + n - 1

        # go backwards from the ends of both arrays
        while p1 >= 0 and p2 >= 0:
            if nums1[p1] > nums2[p2]:
	            nums1[p] = nums1[p1]
	            p1 -= 1
	        else:
		        nums1[p] = nums2[p2]
		        p2 -= 1
		    p -= 1
		    
		# If any leftover elements in nums2, copy them over
		while p2 >= 0:
			nums1[p] = nums2[p2]
			p2 -= 1
			p -= 1
	
```
