### Distributed Systems
- Moore's Law slowing
- Need for higher computation power
- Distributed systems are hard to scale

### In-Network Computing
- Offloads application functions to. network devices
- Benefits inlcude:
	- High throughput
	- Sub-RTT latency
	- High computation speed


### INC architecture
- Changes network architecture


Traditional networks:
- Need a layered architecture which evolves independently, support the Internet ecosystem, but is not efficient


- Trend of large clusters
	- Everything belongs to a single party (no ecostystem)
	- Each layer is programmable
	- Promotes efficiency
