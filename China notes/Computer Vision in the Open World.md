### Human Vision - Computer Vision
- Cameras are not equivalent to human optics
- Computers see a matrix of values (pixels) that is a representation of an image 
- Range of a pixel is integer from 0 to 255
- Images without colors have only 1 channel (matrix)
- If image has color, it has 3 channel tensor (RGB)
- Goal is for computer to interpret images


### Challenges 
- Scale variance, view variance, appearance diversity, occlusion, complex background, motion blur, noise
- Hard to select from a rich image or image distortion/problems
- Computationally intensive

### CV tasks
- Object detection
- Image impenitent
- Pose estimation
- Color generation
- Depth estimation
-
