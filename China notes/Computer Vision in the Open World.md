### Human Vision - Computer Vision
- Cameras are not equivalent to human optics
- Computers see a matrix of values (pixels) that is a representation of an image 
- Range of a pixel is integer from 0 to 255
- Images without colors have only 1 channel (matrix)
- If image has color, it has 3 channel tensor (RGB)
- Goal is for computer to interpret images
