### Programming Languages
- Why are there so many different type of languages? 
	Because it makes programming easier
	- Machine Code
	- Assembly Language
	- High-level programming languages (Imperative programming languages)

### Functional Programming Languages
- Functional and logical programming languages are a separate family
- Describe goal $\to$ computer finds the right computation
- Program: input $\to$ output
- Functional programming language takes the mathematics form of functions
- f(a, b) = a+b is supporte, but f(a+1, b+1) = a+b-2 has a limited support
- Families:
  - Lisp family
  - ML family
  - Haskell
