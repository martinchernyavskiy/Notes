### Ubiquitous Computing
- Mark Weiser was the leading figure in ubiquitous computing who envisioned that every part of life will embed computer so naturally that people won't even think about it.

- Ubiquity: computing available at anytime
- Transparency: invisible, assist people in the background

- Human-centered & Application-driven

- Waves
	- Mainframe (many people use one computer)
	- Personal Computer (one person uses one computer)
	- Ubiquitous Computing (one person uses many computers)

- Computational notions - considering future vision of the past and interpreting the visions in the current context
### Context Awareness
- Context-aware computing systems are aware of physical and social situations they are embedded in (location, proximity, time, etc.)
- Exmmples
	- Automatic door
	- Motion-based lighting

- Context - information that can be used to describe a situation of an entity
- (who, what, when, where)

- context-aware applications use context to provide relevant information of the user to perform a relevant task to the user. Examples inckude:
	- Showcase context
	- Use context to perform a task
	- Tag information


### Human Context Perception
- Perception & Cognitive
- There are a lot of sensors that are built for a specific perception
- Some sensors can provide discrete measurement

- Method 1: Rule based approach
	- Fixed small set of rules that specify context
	- Machine learning approach
