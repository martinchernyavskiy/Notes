- Data Center --> Edge Server --> Device
- Distribution Streaming is between edge server and device

- Increasing resolution increases latency (because the weight of the video is increased that bandwitch may not catch up with)
- Decreasing resolution decreases the latency since the video weight is lower

- *Proactive Cache by AI*
	- CDN (content distribution network built on the modern network infrastructure)
	- ISP (internet service provider)

	- *Charge by overall throughput*
	- *In China, charge is by daily peak bandwith consumption*
