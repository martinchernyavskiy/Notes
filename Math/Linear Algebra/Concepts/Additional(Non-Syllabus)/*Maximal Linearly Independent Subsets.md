## Examples
?
- Example 1: Let F be a family of all subsets of a nonempty set S (this family is called the power set of S). Set S is easily seen to be a maximal element of F
‎ 
- Example 2: Let S and T be disjoint nonempty sets, and let F be the union of their power sets. Then S and T are both maximal elements of F
‎ 
- Example 3: Let F be the family of all finite subsets of an infinite set S. Then F has no maximal element. For if M is any member of F and s in any element of S that is not in M, then $M \cup \{ s \}$ is a member of F that contains M as a proper subset
