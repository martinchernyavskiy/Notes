#linear-algebra

If v in V can be uniquely expresed as a linear combination of vectors of Beta, then beta is the basis for V

Let v be in V, then since v can be expressed as a linear combination of vectors of beta, span(beta) = V since v is arbitrary vector. Confirmed it spanning V!

We need to show that beta is linearly independent for it to be a basis,

that means that for b1, ... ,bn vectors in basis, there is only trivial representation
