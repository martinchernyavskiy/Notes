## Examples
- $\beta = \{ e_{1},\dots,e_{n} \}$, where $e_{1}=(1,0,\dots,0),e_{2}=(0,1,0\dots,0),e_{n}=(0,\dots,0,1)$ is a basis of $\mathbb{R}^2$
‎ .
- $\beta = \{ 1,x,x^2 ,\dots,x^n\}$ is a basis of $P_{n}$
‎ .
- $\beta =\{ e_{1},e_{2},\dots \}$ where $e_{j}$ is a sequence $0,0,\dots,0,1,0,\dots,0,.,..$ where 1 is $j^{th}$ term, is a basis of $V=\{ {se \}$
