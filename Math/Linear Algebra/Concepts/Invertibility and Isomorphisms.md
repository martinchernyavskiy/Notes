## Definition
?
*An inverse of T : V --> W is S : W --> V such that T(S) = Iw and S(T) = Iv. If T has an inverse, it is said to be invertible. Inverse of T is unique and denoted by $T^-1$*

## Properties / Axioms
?
1. $(TU)^-1=U^-1T^-1$
2. $(T^-1)^-1= T$, inverse of T is invertible
3. Function is invertible iff it is both 1-1 and onto. That is, T is invertible iff rank(T) = dim(V) by theorem 2.5 where V and W are of equal dimension
