## Definition
?
*A subset $\{v_{1},\dots,v_{k}\}$ is linearly dependent if there are scalars $a_{1},\dots,a_{k}$ not all zero, such that $a_{1}v_{1}+\dots+a_{k}v_{k}=\vec{0}$, else it's linearly independent*

## Examples
?
- $\{\vec{0}\}$ is linearly dependent since any scalar times $\vec{0}$ equates to $\vec{0}$
â€Ž .
- $\{u\}$ where $u\neq \vec{0}$, is linearly independent since only way to get the linear combination to equate to $\vec{0}$ is by multiplying u by 0
.
- $\{u_{1},u_{2}\}$ is linearly dependent iff one is a scalar multiple of another.
	Suppose $\{u_{1},u_{2}\}$ is linearly dependent. Then, assuming $a_{1} \neq 0$
	$$\begin{array}{l}
a_{1}u_{1}+a_{2}u_{2} = \vec{0} \\
u_{1}+\frac{a_{2}}{a_{1}}u_{2}=\vec{0} \\
u_{1} = -\frac{a_{2}}{a_{1}}u_{2} \end{array}$$
