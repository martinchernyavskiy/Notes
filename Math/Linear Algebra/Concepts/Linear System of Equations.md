## Definition
*Equations in the form of:
$$
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
a_{11}x_{1} + a_{12}x_{2} + \dots + a_{1n}x_{n} = b_{1} \\
\vdots \\
a_{m1}x_{1} + a_{m2}x_{2} + \dots + a_{mn}x_{n} = b_{m}
\end{array}
\right.
$$
Where $(x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{n})$ are variables and $(a_{1},a_{2},\dots a_{n})$ are coefficients*

## Strategies
1. Manipulate equations to get to simpler system
2. Get simplest form and read solutions from it
3. Use three basic equation operations:
	1. $E_{i} \leftrightarrow E_{j}$
	2. $E_{i} \leftrightarrow cE_{i}$
	3. $E_{i} \leftrightarrow E_{i} + cE_{j}$

## Representations
?
- Augmented Matrix w/ elementary row operations that mimic the basic equation operations.
	$m\times(n+1)$ form, right-most being answers to equations.
‎.
- REF form of augmented matrix
	All zero rows are below all non-zero rows
	The leading entry of each row is to the right of the row above it
‎ .
- RREF form of Augmented Matrix
