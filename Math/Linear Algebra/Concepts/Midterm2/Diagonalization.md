## Definition
?
*A linear operator (linear transformation from and to the same vector space) is diagonizable if there exists a basis of V for which the matrix representation of T is diagonal matrix (if there is a basis of eigenvectors)*

## Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues
?
- Eigenvector of a linear operator is non-zero v in V for which T(v) = cv ; v is scaled
- The scalar c is the eigenvalue if there exists v in V for which T(v) = cv
- Thus, T is diagonalizable iff there exists a basis consisting of eigenvectors, which result in matrix representation of T to be a diagonal matrix with eigenvalue entries

## Examples
?
- Find eigenvectors of A ( 0 0 1 
					 0 2 0
					 -2 0 3) with eigenvalue 1
- That means we need all nonzero vectors in N(A - I3)

## Theorems
- Matrix is diagonalizable if its left multiplication transformation is.
	- If there exists Q for which Q^-1 A Q is diagonal
- v in Rn is eigenvector of A if its in kernel of N(A - cIn)
