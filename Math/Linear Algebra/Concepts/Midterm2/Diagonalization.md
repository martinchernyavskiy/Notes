## Definition
?
*A linear operator (linear transformation from and to the same vector space) is diagonizable if there exists a basis of V for which the matrix representation of T is diagonal matrix*

## Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues
?
- Eigenvector of a linear operator is non-zero v in V for which T(v) = cv ; v is scaled
- The scalar c is the eigenvalue if there exists v in V for which T(v) = cv
- Thus, T is diagonalizable iff there exists a basis consisting of eigenvectors, which result in matrix representation of T to be a diagonal matrix with eigenvalue entries
