## Change of Coordinates
?
*Given two different finite bases for V, how are coordinate expressions for its vectors related?*
## Properties / Axioms
?
- Let $\beta \text{ and } \beta^{'}$ be such two bases. Then $[v]_{\beta^{'}} = [I_{V}(v)]_{\beta^{'}} = [I_{V}]_{\beta}^{\beta^{'}}[v]_{\beta}$ 


## Example
?
- Let V = P1, beta = 1, x, beta2 = 1+x, 1-x
- $[I_{V}]_{\beta}^{\beta^{'}}$ equals to matrix where columns are coordinate expressions of image of the domain basis vectors in terms of basis vectors of codomain basis.
