## Definition
*A subspace is a subset of a vector space such that 0 vector is in it and it's closed under addition and scalar multiplication*

## Properties / Axioms
1. $\vec{0}\in W$
2. $\forall w_{1},w_{2} \in W, \quad w_{1}+w_{2} \in W$
3. $\forall c \in F,\forall w \in W, \quad  cw\in W$

## Examples
- Example 1: ...
- Example 2: ...
- Example 3: ...

## Non-examples
- $W=[0,1] \subset\mathbb{R}$, since $1+1\not\in W$
- $W = \mathbb{Z}\subset \mathbb{R}$, since $\pi*z\not\in \mathbb{Z}$
