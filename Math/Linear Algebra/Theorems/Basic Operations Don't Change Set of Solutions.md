### Theorem: None of the basic operations change the set of solutions
?
#### Proof:
1,2 in [[Linear System of Equations#Strategies]] are obvious.
For 3, suppose $(x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{n})$ is a solution of:
$$
\begin{array}{l}
a_{11}x_{1}+\dots a_{1n}x_{n}=b_{1} \\
a_{21}x_{1}+\dots a_{2n}x_{n}=b_{2}
\end{array}
$$
Then adding first equation to second gives:
$$
\begin{array}{l}
a_{11}x_{1}+\dots a_{1n}x_{n}=b_{1} \\
(a_{11}+a_{21})x_{1}+\dots (a_{1n}+a_{2n})x_{n}=b_{1}+b_{2}
\end{array}
$$
Since 1,2 don't change the set of solutions, 3 doesn't either as we can derive either of the initial equations by subtracting the second from it.
This completes the proof. $\square$
