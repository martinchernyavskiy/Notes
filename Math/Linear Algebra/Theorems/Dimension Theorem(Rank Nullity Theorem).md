### Theorem: If $T:V \to W$ is linear and V is finite dimensional, then $dim(N(T))+dim(R(T))=dim(V)$, $nullity + rank$ of T respectively

#### Proof: 
Set $dimV=n$
$N(T)$ is a subspace of V of $dim \space k\leq n$ by [[Dimension of Subspace Is At Most The Dimension of Vector Space]]
Let $\beta_{N}=\{ u_{1},\dots,u_{k} \}$ be a basis of N(T)


This completes the proof. $\square$
