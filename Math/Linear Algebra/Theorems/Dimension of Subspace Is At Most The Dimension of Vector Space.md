### Theorem: Let W be a subspace of V. If V is finite dimensional, then $dimW\leq dimV$ with $dimW=dimV$ iff $W=V$
?
#### Proof: 
Suppose $dimV=n$, then let $\beta_{V} = \{ u_{1},\dots,u_{n} \}$ be a basis for V.
Let $\mathcal{U} = \{ w_{1},\dots,w_{k} \} \subset W$ be a linearly independent subset of W.
By Replacement Theorem, ($S=\beta_{V},U=\mathcal{U} \to k\leq n$)
With this observation, we can construct a basis of W, recursively.
IF $W = \{  \}$

This completes the proof. $\square$
