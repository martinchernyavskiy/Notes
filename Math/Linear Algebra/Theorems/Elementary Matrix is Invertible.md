### Theorem: Each elementary matrix is invertible
?
#### Proof: 
Since each elementary row operation can be undone, applying a row operation on the elementary matrix and applying another operation to then undo the previous one results in an identity matrix:
E(R)E(R^-1) = In
This completes the proof. $\square$
