### Theorem: Every matrix can be put in RREF by a finite sequence of elementary row operations
?
#### Proof: 
The elementary row operations in question are:
1. 
We will proof by construction (Gauss Elimination).
Consider matrix: $$\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
3 & 2 & 1 & 2
\end{pmatrix}
$$


This completes the proof. $\square$

### Immediately follow:

#### 1.RREF of a matrix is unique
#### 2. Solution set of a linear system w/ augmented matrix in RREF is easily described in a standard way
