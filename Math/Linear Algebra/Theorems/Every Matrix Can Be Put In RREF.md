### Theorem: Every matrix can be put in RREF by a finite sequence of elementary row operations
?
#### Proof: 
...
...
...

This completes the proof. $\square$

### Immediately follow:

#### 1.RREF of a matrix is unique
#### 2. Solution set of a linear system w/ augmented matrix in RREF is easily described in a standard way
