### Theorem: For any r = 1, ..., n, the determinant formula holds, but with r used in place of 1s previously
?
#### Proof: 
To prove we need results from technical lemma, if rth row of B is ej, then det(B) =  (-1)^4+j times det(~Brj)
Then given A and Bj where Bj is A but with rth row of A replaced by ej, it follows:
det(Bj) = (-1)^r+j det(~Bj)rj
		= (-1)^r+j det(~Arj)

This completes the proof. $\square$
