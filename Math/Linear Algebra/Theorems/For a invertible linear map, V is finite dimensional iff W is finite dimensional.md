### Theorem: Let T be an invertible linear transformation from V to W. Then V is finite-dimensional if and only if W is finite-dimensional. In this case, dim(V) = dim(W).

#### Proof: 
Suppose that V is finite-dimensional with an n-dimensional basis. Then since T is invertible, it must be both one-to-one and onto. Since T(V basis) spans R(T) and R(T) = W since T is onto, W is finite dimensional as spanning set can be reduced to a finite basis (it's not guaranteed that T(V basis) vectors are linearly independent). 
	Proving the opposite is a similar argument, but we use T^-1 instead. Let w1, ..., wn be basis vectors for W. Then T(W basis) spans 
Since V and W are finite dimensional and T is 1-1 and onto, then nullity(T) = 0 --> 

This completes the proof. $\square$
