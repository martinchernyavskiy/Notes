### Theorem: Let T be an invertible linear transformation from V to W. Then V is finite-dimensional if and only if W is finite-dimensional. In this case, dim(V) = dim(W).
?
#### Proof: 
Suppose that V is finite-dimensional with an n-dimensional basis. Then since T is invertible, it must be both one-to-one and onto. Since T(V basis) = R(T) and R(T)

This completes the proof. $\square$
