### Theorem: Let $T: V \to W$ be a linear map between vector spaces of same finite dimension. Then if the transformation is either 
?
By [[Dimension Theorem(Rank Nullity Theorem)]], nullity(T) + rank(T) = dim(V).
By [[Transformation is 1-1 iff N(T) consists only of 0 vector]], T is one-to-one iff N(T) = {0}, iff nullity (T) = 0, iff rank(T) = dim(V), iff rank(T) = dim(W), iff dim(R(T)) = dim(W) and by [[Dimension of Subspace Is At Most The Dimension of Vector Space]], R(T) = W
This completes the proof. $\square$
