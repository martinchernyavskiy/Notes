### Theorem: Let $T: V \to W$ be a linear map between vector spaces of same finite dimension. Then the transformation is a bijection and rank(T) = dim(V)
?
#### Proof: 
Recall $A \in M_{m \times n}$ defines a linear map $L_{A}: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$
$\bar{x} \to A \bar{x}$
We will show that any linear map between finite dimensional vector spaces can be represented by a matrix.
Ex: $T_{d}: P_{3} \to P_{2}$
	$f \to f^1$
Ex: $T_{i}: P_{2} \to P_{3}$
	$f \to \int_{0}^x{f(t)dt}$

This completes the proof. $\square$
