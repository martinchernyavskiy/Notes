### Theorem: Suppose $\{u_{1},\dots,u_{k}\} \subset V$ is linearly dependent, there is a subset $\{u_{i1},\dots u_{il}\}$ that satisfies $Span(\{u_{i1},\dots u_{il}\})=Span(\{u_{1},\dots,u_{k}\})$
?
#### Proof: 
By [[Linearly Dependent Subset Vector as Linear Combination of Others]], since $\{u_{1},\dots,u_{k}\}$ is linearly dependent, for some j,
$u_{j}=b_{1}v_{1}+\dots+b_{j-1}u_{j-1}+b_{j+1}u_{j+1}+\dots+b_{k}u_{k}$
We remove $u_{j}$ from the set.
**Claim:** $Span(\{u_{i1},\dots u_{il}\})=Span(\{u_{1},\dots,,\dots,u_{k}\})$
This completes the proof. $\square$
