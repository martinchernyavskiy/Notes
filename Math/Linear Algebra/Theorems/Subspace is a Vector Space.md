### Theorem: If $W \subset V$ is a subspace, then W is a vector space where operations are inherited from V
?
#### Proof:
Given V satisfies all 8 properties and W satisfies subspace properties. We need W to satisfy all 8 properties of a vector space.
Since $W\subset V$, properties 1-2 and 5-8 are inherited from V. For 3rd property, since W is a subspace, $\vec{0}V\in W$ and $\vec{0}V=\vec{0}W$
For 4th property, since $\forall w \in W$ is also in V, there is $v \in V$ such that $w+v=\vec{0}$. In fact, $v=-1(w)$ from [[Elementary Properties of Vector Spaces]], thus $v \in W$ since $W$ is closed under scalar multiplication.


This completes the proof. $\square$
