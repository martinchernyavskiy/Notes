### Theorem: If $T: V \to W$ is linear, then T is 1-1 iff $N(T)=\{ \vec{0_{V}} \}$
?
#### Proof:
Suppose T is one-to-one and $x \in N(T)$. Then T(x) = 0 = T(0), so x = 0 since T is one-to one and N(T) = {0}
Now suppose that N(T) = {0} and suppose for some x,y in V, T(x) = T(y). Then T(x) - T(y) = 0 = T(x-y) since T is linear. Thus x-y  in N(T) and x-y= 0 or x = y and so T is one-to-one
This completes the proof. $\square$
