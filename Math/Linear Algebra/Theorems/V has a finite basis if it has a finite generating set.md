### Theorem: If V has a finite generating set, then V has a finite basis
?
#### Proof:
Follows from [[Refinement Theorem]]. If $\{u_{1},\dots,u_{k}\}$ is a finite generating set, then we can find a subset $\{u_{i1},\dots,u_{il}\}$ which is linearly independent and spans V.
This completes the proof. $\square$
