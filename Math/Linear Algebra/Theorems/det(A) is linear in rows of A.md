### Theorem:  det(A) is linear in rows of A
?
#### Proof: 
We will prove two cases, r = 1 and r > 1
For r = 1, det(A) = standard sum formula with first row of A being sum of 1st row of B and k of first row of C. 
The matrices with 1st row crossed out are identical.
Using the sum formula and substituting B1j + kC1j into A1j, we get det(A) = det(B) + kdet(C)
.
For r > 1, we argue by induction 

This completes the proof. $\square$

### Immediately follow:

#### det(A) = det(B) + kdet(C)
