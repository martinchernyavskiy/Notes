*Purpose is to build mathematical models for experiments with random outcomes*

### Ingredients of Probability Model
?
- *Sample space* ($\Omega$): set of all possible outcomes of the experiment. Elements of sample space are called sample points and denoted by w
- Subsets of sample space are called *events*, collection of events is $\mathcal{F}$ (*event space*)
- *Probability Distribution/Measure* function P from F into real numbers. 
- *Probability space*: is a triple ($\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P$)

### Probability (Kolmogorov) Axioms
?
- 0 <= P(A) <= 1 for each event A
- P(sample space) = 1 and P(empty set) = 0
- If $A_{1}, A_{2}, \dots$ is sequence of pairwise disjoint events, their probability is the sum of probabilities of each single event

### Examples
- Coin flip, dice roll, self-explanatory
