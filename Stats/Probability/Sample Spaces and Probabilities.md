*Purpose is to build mathematical models for experiments with random outcomes*

### Ingredients of Probability Model
?
- *Sample space* (omega): set of all possible outcomes of the experiment. Elements of sample space are called sample points and denoted by w
- Subsets of sample space are called *events*
-
