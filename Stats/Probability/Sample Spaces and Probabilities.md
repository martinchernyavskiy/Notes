*Purpose is to build mathematical models for experiments with random outcomes*

### Ingredients of Probability Model
?
- *Sample space* (omega): set of all possible outcomes of the experiment. Elements of sample space are called sample points and denoted by w
- Subsets of sample space are called *events*
- *Probability Distribution/Measure* function P from F into real numbers. 

### Probability Axioms
- 0 <= P(A) <= 1 for each event A
- P(sample space) = 1 and P(empty set) = 0
